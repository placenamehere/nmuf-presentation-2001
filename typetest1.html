<h1>Politician Turns Pizza Man</h1>
<p>CANBERRA (Reuters) - Australian Treasurer Peter Costello said Wednesday he had taken time out to deliver pizza advertising leaflets -- to cover for his 14-year-old son.</p>
<p>Costello, heir apparent to Prime Minister John Howard, confessed to donning a hat and overcoat in a bid to disguise himself while delivering the flyers for his son, who had neglected his after-school delivery job.</p>
<p>``Like a lot of kids he was out all weekend and he hadn't done his rounds so I thought I'd better do it for him,'' Costello told the Seven Network's Current Affair program.</p>
<p>``I donned a hat and a big overcoat and went round in the early hours of the morning delivering leaflets for the local pizza joint,'' Costello said.</p>
<p>The treasurer, who delivered his sixth federal budget on Tuesday, said his son at least appeared to be an entrepreneur.</p>
<p>``He gets paid A$3 (US$1.55) an hour but I want you to know he didn't share any of it with me... he's obviously a businessman because he had someone working for him for free,'' Costello said.</p>
