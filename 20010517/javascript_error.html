I have tried hard to make this project multi-browser and multi-platform friendly. Some of the techniques used, however, take advantage of some of the more recent advancements in the JavaScript language and so browsers like Netscape 4 may turn a blueish purple and choke to death. If you think you have a 'recent' browser and indeed that it's my code that is bad, then <strong>please</strong> email me at <a href="mailto:cac6982@placenamehere.com" style="color:rgb(138,145,147);">cac6982@placenamehere.com</a>. Hate mail is also accepted.</p>
