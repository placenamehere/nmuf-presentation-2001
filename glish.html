Easy to understand, easy to implement. I first saw this layout at <a class="sitelinksredorange" href="http://www.wrongwaygoback.com">dynamic ribbon device</a> and have since learned that the sweet CSS came from Rob Chandanais of <a class="sitelinksredorange" href="http://www.bluerobot.com">BlueRobot</a>. Owen also made a very nice <a class="sitelinksredorange" href="http://members.home.net/bigstripes/tutorial/css_3box_plus_topbox.html">tutorial</a> using this layout technique.</p>		<p><a class="sitelinksredorange" href="9.asp">2 Columns, ALA Style</a> &#151; Famously chronicled by Jeffrey Zeldman in his ALA article <a class="sitelinksredorange" href="http://www.alistapart.com/stories/journey/"> A Web Designer's Journey</a>, this is an extremely easy layout to implement requiring only a simple float:left declaration.</p>		<p><a class="sitelinksredorange" href="8.asp">4 Columns, All Fluid</a> &#151; This technique can actually be used to provide as many columns on a page as you like. Drawback #1) it gets difficult quickly if you want to make any of the columns a fixed width.  Drawback #2) it relies heavily on percentages, which the various browsers all calculate differently, so you can't place your columns very precisely. Still, a very useful technique, especially if you don't want borders and different background colors for your columns. I first saw it in use at <a class="sitelinksredorange" href="http://www.statikmajik.com">Statik Majik</a>.</p>		<p><a class="sitelinksredorange" href="2.asp">3 Columns, All Fluid</a> &#151; A much simpler and potentially more useful technique that then 4 column technique above. It uses float:left, suffers from needing percentage widths for each column, and from potential column wrapping when the browser window is narrowed.</p>		<p><a class="sitelinksredorange" href="3.asp">Static Width and Centered</a> &#151; 3 columns all with static widths, and contained in a parent DIV which remains centered in the window. One rather serious limitation of this particular technique is that if any of the three content DIVs contains an image or a really long word that is longer than the width of the DIV, it totally breaks the layout. Each browser breaks it differently.</p>		<p><a class="sitelinksredorange" href="1.asp">Nested Float</a> &#151; A very simple layout that features a nested, floated menu in the upper right. Easily reversed. A variation of this technique is in use on this very page.</p>		<!--<p><a class="sitelinksredorange" href="">Dealing with the CSS box Model</a> &#151; IE5 Mac, NS6, Opera 5; they all handle borders and padding correctly, adding them to the width of the box. But IE5 PC gets it all wrong, placing them within the width of the box. IE5 PC's implementation is arguably easier to work with (scratch that, it <em>is</em> easier to work with), but that is beside the point. How do you deal with this discrepancy between the browsers? There are ways, my friends, there are ways.</p>-->	</div>		<p class="anchor"><a class="sitelinksredorange anchor" name="resources" href="#top">straight to the top</a></p>		<h2>CSS Resources</h2>	<p>Specs, primers, validators, stuff like that</p>	<div class="links">		<p><a class="sitelinksorange" href="http://www.htmlhelp.com/reference/css/">Guide to Cascading Style Sheets</a> from the Web Design Group. &#151; An excellent primer if you need to start from scratch.

Easy to understand, easy to implement. I first saw this layout at <a class="sitelinksredorange" href="http://www.wrongwaygoback.com">dynamic ribbon device</a> and have since learned that the sweet CSS came from Rob Chandanais of <a class="sitelinksredorange" href="http://www.bluerobot.com">BlueRobot</a>. Owen also made a very nice <a class="sitelinksredorange" href="http://members.home.net/bigstripes/tutorial/css_3box_plus_topbox.html">tutorial</a> using this layout technique.</p>		<p><a class="sitelinksredorange" href="9.asp">2 Columns, ALA Style</a> &#151; Famously chronicled by Jeffrey Zeldman in his ALA article <a class="sitelinksredorange" href="http://www.alistapart.com/stories/journey/"> A Web Designer's Journey</a>, this is an extremely easy layout to implement requiring only a simple float:left declaration.</p>		<p><a class="sitelinksredorange" href="8.asp">4 Columns, All Fluid</a> &#151; This technique can actually be used to provide as many columns on a page as you like. Drawback #1) it gets difficult quickly if you want to make any of the columns a fixed width.  Drawback #2) it relies heavily on percentages, which the various browsers all calculate differently, so you can't place your columns very precisely. Still, a very useful technique, especially if you don't want borders and different background colors for your columns. I first saw it in use at <a class="sitelinksredorange" href="http://www.statikmajik.com">Statik Majik</a>.</p>		<p><a class="sitelinksredorange" href="2.asp">3 Columns, All Fluid</a> &#151; A much simpler and potentially more useful technique that then 4 column technique above. It uses float:left, suffers from needing percentage widths for each column, and from potential column wrapping when the browser window is narrowed.</p>		<p><a class="sitelinksredorange" href="3.asp">Static Width and Centered</a> &#151; 3 columns all with static widths, and contained in a parent DIV which remains centered in the window. One rather serious limitation of this particular technique is that if any of the three content DIVs contains an image or a really long word that is longer than the width of the DIV, it totally breaks the layout. Each browser breaks it differently.</p>		<p><a class="sitelinksredorange" href="1.asp">Nested Float</a> &#151; A very simple layout that features a nested, floated menu in the upper right. Easily reversed. A variation of this technique is in use on this very page.</p>		<!--<p><a class="sitelinksredorange" href="">Dealing with the CSS box Model</a> &#151; IE5 Mac, NS6, Opera 5; they all handle borders and padding correctly, adding them to the width of the box. But IE5 PC gets it all wrong, placing them within the width of the box. IE5 PC's implementation is arguably easier to work with (scratch that, it <em>is</em> easier to work with), but that is beside the point. How do you deal with this discrepancy between the browsers? There are ways, my friends, there are ways.</p>-->	</div>		<p class="anchor"><a class="sitelinksredorange anchor" name="resources" href="#top">straight to the top</a></p>		<h2>CSS Resources</h2>	<p>Specs, primers, validators, stuff like that</p>	<div class="links">		<p><a class="sitelinksorange" href="http://www.htmlhelp.com/reference/css/">Guide to Cascading Style Sheets</a> from the Web Design Group. &#151; An excellent primer if you need to start from scratch.
